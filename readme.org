* GGJ entry 2022 
4 developers working on their global game jam entry using a custom made JS based ECS game engine called DECS.
DECS is currently still in closed source development, thats why it is linked using a private SSH npm package.
If anyone wants access to the decs js repo they can reach out to me personnaly I will then disclose the source.
